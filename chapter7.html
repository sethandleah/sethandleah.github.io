        <div class="container">

                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                    <p>Kimerly here we come</p>

                    <p>After two-and-a-half hours the bus finally arrives at the neighboring town of Kokstad and people started getting off the bus one by one, some close to banks, others at hospitals and retail shops, some just got off and started walking
                        before they disappeared into the crowds and busy streets. Seth knew that there were billions of people in the world but he believed it only because his parents had told him so, but now he could see some of the things he was told
                        were budding into fruition. </p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, the driver had instructed Seth that he should not get off but would be taken specially to his drop off point and as everyone dismounted off the bus. An old lady who could barely walk and used crutches asked her helper who
                        seemed to be his son to get her closer to Seth’s window. The old lady hit Seth with a wide toothless banana smile and said I have lived long enough upon this Earth and surely you, my child, you are blessed. Then she turned away
                        and headed to the hospital gate where she was met with a wheelchair and driven off by a man and woman wearing white coats. All this and many others were still new to Seth and therefore availed nothing for he was still gutted but
                        what the old lady did crushed a beavers wall and sent torrents of admirers to Seth’s window. </p>

                    <p>People, as they got off the bus, came to Seth’s window just to greet him and hold his hands, while some just looked at him. Amongst the hoard of people, there came a middle-aged fellow and offered Seth a huge silver coin. Baffled and
                        bewildered by this gesture Seth was reluctant to take it because he was not used to being given things without a reason or instruction. Seth was used to being given his food and told to eat or when his father said take these seeds
                        to your mother in the house, things like that. The driver seeing that Seth didn’t comprehend the kind gesture of the man prompted Seth to take the coin, but Seth was still hesitant and timid to the offer when a whirlwind of thoughts
                        bombarded Seth’s mind about a story his dad had once told him. </p>

                    <p>The story was about an indigenous South African Prophet called Ntsikane who heard the word of the Mighty and Terrible One about the advent of European missionaries, he prophesied to and against the men of his day. Thus he said: “children
                        shall bare children, youngones shall take up smoking at young ages, the love of money shall consume many and many shall be deceived by it...”Seth like most young lad’s would disrupt the storyteller and ask questions, therefore
                        he came to understand that the button without holes was that which the man was giving to him and Seth knew very well that the button without holes was like the Forbidden Apple of old. </p>

                    <p>Now the fears of his parents were bearing fruit, Seth was in Sin City where humanity values vanity, where prophets prophesy folly, where priest dwell in fornication, infants are wine bibbers and harlots of Sodom. After comprehending
                        his curse presented as a gift Seth wept bitterly with an outpouring cry of immense grief that brought awe to onlookers. People were astonished at this site, it was unheard of, a child was crying for being given money. Did he want
                        more or what? Seeing this the driver said let this boy be and bother him no more and he drove off until no one but Seth was left on the bus.
                    </p>

                    <p>The pain was just too much for little Seth who’s heart was being maced into millions of tiny pieces. The bus driver was beginning to panic, never before had he seen such a child, who cried with unparalleled sadness which was impossible
                        for any child to know or feel.</p>

                    <p>Some were local, some national and crossed borders; it is here where Seth and his luggage got off. With a solemn voice the driver pleaded with Seth to overcome his anguish, "My child please I beg you it is enough now please be strong
                        and be a man everything is going to be ok. " It was as if an Angel had just spoken and appealed to the Soul with reassurance “everything is going to be ok” was definitely not about the now. Slowly with every passing moment, Seth
                        gave in, calming and wiping himself dry. The driver brushed his head in encouragement and they both got off the bus. With his leather purse strapped on him, the bus driver said son wait here while I go over there, pointing at a
                        group of man not so far away. On his way the driver passes two young boys and instructs them pointing at Seth, to go and offload Seth’s bag from the top of the bus.
                    </p> 

                    <p>To be continued...</p>
