                    <p>Young Seth Leaves Home</p>

                    <p>Back to his mom with the fattest chicken, he could find, it was white hen with black freckled dots all over its plumage. Here it is mom I have got it. You have done well my son, now go and gather some wood for fire that we may pluck off its feathers. Once again Seth took off without any hesitation or questions for that was his nature. Meanwhile, he was piling up firewood; three young men approached his father who stood by the garden gate a few feet in front of the house. The threesome greeted Seth’s father with great humility and respect, for Seth’s father was known throughout the village as the only educated man and was an MK veteran during the liberation struggles.</p>

                    <p>Above all Seth’s parents were kind Christians who raised their children strictly so. Seth still looking at these young men tried to envision himself having brothers, though Seth was a visionary who always tried to envision the stories he grew up with about the Israelites Jesus and His Disciples. He notices that the trio and his dad were now headed for the sheep pen where he saw one sheep that was not released to graze with others, there and there the sheep was slaughtered, dressed and hung upon the garden’s wooden fencing. There and there his fears were realized, he was indeed leaving his family and village for a land he knew not. This troubled Seth deeply who started weeping exceedingly. Seth knew not any form of comfort except his faithful mother’s bosom where he rested and was told stories from morning to noon time.</p>

                    <p>Seth’s mother in consoling her little one, said, “now-now Seth be of good cheer and be glad at heart for now I shall read you a story but not according to our accustomed fashion but we will read wherever the Spirit will permit. Now let us both close our eyes and wherever I shall open the Scriptures there shall we read.” Seth agreed and closed his teary eyes. After a few seconds, they both opened their eyes and Seth’s mother read according to this manner “I have plans for you, saith the Lord, plans not to hurt you but to prosper you”, there they left it and did not continue as usual.</p>

                    <p>Outside it was dusk and two fire were lit, one by sheep pen and the other was the one Seth had collected to wood for. Now tonight something was in the air, the three men could not on feel it but could see it as well. It was not the somber mood of the Rhadebe’s, no something weird happened as the sun was setting far on the mountainous western skyline. A thin misty cloud membrane glazed the horizon with a deep crimson color that turned the whole atmosphere in shades of red, pink and orange. This is not unusual, yes it occurs once in awhile but on the ground, something astounding happened, as the cloud reflected and turned everything underneath it red, the Rhadebe’s we somehow immune to it.</p>

                    <p>For them, it was as if it was still in the afternoon, even for Seth’s mom who was at a distance plucking the chicken. This each of the three men did notice very clearly but each held his peace in awe of what was before them, but fear overwhelmed them as to how could they ever explain this. So they shook off their heads and paid attention to what it is they came for, the sooner they did that the sooner the whole thing dissipated from the atmosphere. The blinding fire smoke and the pleasures of being about to eat meat consumed their every thought and seating there with one of the most feared men in the village, even above the chief, it was unbelievable. Even their livestock was renowned for being fat, and numerous also with every passing season their garden and fields were always well tilted with corn, amabele, pumpkins, peas, beans and all sort of herbs and vegetables. Just as the sun was falling beyond the dark mountainous horizon it predestined the coming of the two shepherds’ with herds and herds of livestock which sent the ground shaking as they made it up the steep hill and into their kraals, pens, and sheds.</p>

                    <p>To be continued...</p>
