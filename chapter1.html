                    <p>The Budding Lotus</p>

                    <p>In the land of the rising sun where nature abounds and flourishes freely. Far far away at the tip of the African continent in a land rich with diversity and beauty, jungles rich and filled with all life and wonder from the miniature ant to the mighty elephant and towering giraffes.</p>

                    <p>There lived a family of three, remote and cut off from society. They lived on a conical mountain encircled by a river and clothed in lush green indigenous forestry. Running wild amidst the tall green leafy trees was a young 8-year-old boy, barefoot and covered in mud, with grass and forest matter all tangled on his little Afro. All that covered his tiny body was a callus loin cloth made of cow skin. As he frantically wondered, lost in the maze of nature as if on a quest for lost treasures he looks around </p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p> I found it mom, I found it; it was the voice that was approaching the edge of the forest. Safe in its saviour's arms the lamb leaped off upon seeing the sun and the mountain it called home. Along the sloped mountain the lamb found it bleating mother separate from the massive grazing flock that painted the hill white. </p>

                    <p> Mom I’m here, I’m fine said the young one as he also made a run for his mom. There was Seth’s mom standing on a huge rock overlooking the dense green forest with her hand over her eyebrows protecting her eyes from the violent sun rays that shone from the east while the other was on her waist, signalling great concern. The boy is hugged as if he just emerged from the dead, Seth my child you know how your father and I feel about you playing far from the house. Seth with his little head dropped; I am sorry mom, I had to help that lamb get back to its mother. It's fine my son you are just like your father, I’m just happy that you are fine, come it's time for dinner. </p>

                    <p>On a rocking chair looking down a hill filled with grazing domestic flocks and herds of all sorts was a grey headed and heavily bearded old man. From cattle, to sheep, goats, horses, and even donkeys they all populated the slope even down to the river. While around the house and the yard was a multitude of poultry from ducks coming for a landing, to turkeys, geese and chicken all with trains of young ones tailing not so far. </p>

                    <p>To be continued...</p>
